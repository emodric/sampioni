# Šampioni

This is a site rip of now defunct http://www.sampioni.com, webpage that detailed the account of two friends
working in a software development company where clean code, SOLID principles or DRY motto were nothing more
than wishful thinking of said two friends, no matter how much they struggled to make them a reality.

They called their co-workers "champions" (šampioni) and some of them even "world champions", based on their
level of "skill".

The site is written in Croatian and is preserved in all of its original glory, without any modifications.
